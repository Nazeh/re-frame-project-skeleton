# Chris Oakman re-frame Project Skeleton

The purpose of this project is to help developers get started with a project
skeleton for a [ClojureScript] project that uses [re-frame] and [shadow-cljs]
quickly.

This project is more opinionated than some other starter projects (see Other
Projects section), so there is more code here than you might expect from a
"starter pack".

## How to use

```sh
npx @chrisoakman/re-frame-project-skeleton my-name.my-proj
```

## Libraries Used

- [shadow-cljs]
- [re-frame] for React.js / DOM management
- [bide] for routing
- [timbre] for logging

## Other Similar Projects / Approaches

- [create-cljs-app](https://github.com/filipesilva/create-cljs-app)
